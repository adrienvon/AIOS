keynote a new connection or a great

moment at the event make sure to post

your updates on social media and and tag

them with the # pytorch comp so we can

amplify your highlights with the

community now let's take a brief moment

to talk about the pytorch foundation and

why it's such a key driver of innovation

in open source in AI as many of you know

the foundation was established as a

vendor neutral entity in 2022 to support

and Steward the pytorch ecosystem

ensuring it remains open accessible and

community-driven

the foundation's mission is not just

about being a neutral home for the PCH

framework but also about fostering

collaboration research education and the

growth of the ecosystem making sure that

everyone from startups to large

Enterprises have the resources they need

to

thrive we also work closely with

industry leaders Academia and the open

source Community to ensure that pytorch

continues to evolve and scale to meet

the demands of the next generation of AI

Technologies and with ongoing

contributions and new tools from the

pytorch community the future of pytorch

looks brighter than

ever back in 2022 the pytorch foundation

was supported by six founding

members fast forward to two years later

and now we have 12 Premier members and a

growing list of general and Associate

members and as the PCH family continues

to grow we are pleased to announce that

arm has recently joined the P Church

Foundation as a premier member

so let's take a moment to appreciate the

incredible growth of the pytorch

conference over the past two years in

2022 we were small collocated event with

nups with just over 300 attendees

running a one-day event with two

tracks by 2023 we had grown to over 600

attendees and expanded to four tracks

over the course of the day we introduced

new features like the poster reception

which added even more opportunities for

collaboration and learning

now in 2024 we've taken it to a whole

new level we've received over 16

actually 1,700 registrations as of this

morning more than four times the number

from two years ago this year's event

spans two days with three tracks and

includes exciting additions like the

startup showcase and two new Mini

Summits this growth is a testament to

the power of the pytorch community and

the growing importance of P torch in the

overall AI

ecosystem we couldn't be more thrilled

to see how far we've come and this is

really just the

beginning it's an understatement to say

that pytorch has seen explosive growth

in the last couple of years let's take a

quick look at the incredible growth and

impact of the pytorch

project over 15,000 organizations have

made contributions and 60% of AI

research implementations are choosing

pytorch on GitHub there are over 600,000

repos leveraging the framework with more

than 20% year-over-year

growth so far this year alone we've seen

over 6,000 commits and we have 110

active projects in the pytorch ecosystem

these numbers reflect a vibrant and

constantly evolving Community pushing

the boundaries of AI

Innovation there are now more than

177,000 organizations that are actively

using pytorch research development and

in

production if you attended last year's

conference you would have no doubt seen

Joe bac's pytorch history timeline we

have some additions for 2023 and 2024

including the release of pytorch 2.0 2.1

along with execu torch last year and

this year the release of pytorch 2.4

along with torch tune torch chat torch

Titan which is in Pre in

pre-release pytorch is a global

Community with contributions continuing

to grow from around the world with 59

different countries contributing to the

project just this year

alone pytorch has seen a substantial

increase in contributions in 2024 over

3500 individuals and over 3,000

organizations are currently contributing

to pytorch compare that with just two

years ago when there were only 200 100

organizations

contributing and it's not just pytorch

core that has seen explosive growth the

pytorch ecosystem has continued to grow

having added an additional 20 ecosystem

tools in the past year for over for now

for a total of 110

projects so what's next for the PCH

Foundation we're excited to expand

presence across industry conferences and

we're collaborating closely with open

source program offices to ensure that

pytorch remains the leading machine

learning framework in the world our

focus is on making sure that the

industry has all the resources and

support necessary to leverage pytorch to

its fullest

potential we're also looking to grow the

Pyro ecosystem by welcoming more Cutting

Edge tools and projects ensuring that

developers and researchers have access

to the Best in Class tools libraries and

resources

in addition we're thrilled to be

developing a pytorch ambassador program

designed to empower Community leaders

and amplify their contributions as a

part of our commitment to education

we're working on pytorch training

courses and

certifications this will equip the next

generation of AI developers and

researchers with the skills they need to

excel in the field of

AI and before wrapping up I want to make

this make to take this moment to express

our deepest gratitude to everyone in the

pych community

whether you're writing code testing new

features reporting bugs crafting

documentation or offering support in the

forums you are the backbone of

everything we do your your dedication

and collaboration are what Drive The

Innovation and success of this

platform we couldn't do without you so

from the bottom of our hearts thank you

for your commitment your contributions

and for making ptch what it is today
